# MEN Stack (MongoDB, ExpressJS, Node.js)

## What does this do?
This is a sample code demonstrating a basic interaction between **MongoDB**, and **Node.js** (with the help of **ExpressJS** for proper routing).

A simple single-page app, with the help of jQuery for ajax calls to the Node.js server, and navigating through pages. It emphasizes the use of basic CRUD operations for MongoDB.

## Requirements
* MongoDB server
* Node.js (I used the LTS)

## Installation
1. Run `npm install` inside the project via terminal / cmd
2. Make sure MongoDB server is properly set up, and running
3. Run `node index` inside the project via terminal / cmd.
4. Open a browser and type `localhost:3000` (you can change the port being used on *index.js*)

To close the server, just press `ctrl + c` (depends on OS terminal)
